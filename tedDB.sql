I belive the books and the free market speak for themselves (IN MOST CASES), so why thrust a imaginary support level on the auction? The cgc census report is now avalable on their web site, cgccomics.com (as of 7-12-01). I strongly encourage all serious bidders to visit this site, especially when bidding on more expensive or scarce books. Many of the books I offer up on ebay and on my website are of the highest slabbed grades at present, or in a good number of times-the ONLY book of it\'s kind to have been graded. This information is powerful when buying, selling or bidding. I am a CGC Charter member, and AACC member. My grading is guaranteed,-refering to unslabbed books, naturally- I have been a collector and seller/dealer for over 35 years. Many references available, if you need them. If not satisfied I will return a full refund for the books, as long as they are returned in original condition. All items packed securely. Shipping is $6 in the Cont.USA. Insurance is extra-$2 and up-(for merchadise $100 or more) depending on price of book, and I will not be responsible for uninsured books(anything over $100). I usually ship ONCE a week depending on volume, (sometimes more), using either USPS-priority mail, OR Fed Ex ground, either takes 2-4 days. All CGC books are non returnable, I will warrenty against any cracks in the slab, though. Most (USPS) books sent by certified. Overseas postage is at LEAST $15 per package, so please keep this in mind if you are bidding from overseas, or just please refrain from bidding. Also, most bidders are honorable, but do not bid if you are unsure that you can make payment and agree to terms. For USA orders, you may combine up to 5 CGC books and up to 12 non CGC books per order. Thanks for looking, have fun, and please visit my web site and other auctions.
